# StrangeRunningData

### INTRODUCTION

Running apps like JOYRUN and KEEP synchronize running datas via GARMIN CONNECT, but running apps do not perform strict data validation. That brings some intersting results.

I provide a modified *fit* file that can be upload to some running apps.

### USAGE

1. Download the *fit* file in this repo and upload it to your GARMIN CONNECT account as an activity.
2. In running apps which enable GARMIN data synchronization, you just need to synchronize your activity created in step 1 to your running app.
3. See the result.

### RESULT

See the results in my running apps in *backup* directory.
